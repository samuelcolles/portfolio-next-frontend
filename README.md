### Overview

I needed a portfolio to show off to potential employers, this website was born. However, I wanted to make something a little bit more interesting so I decided to manage the content with a backend. I chose strapi for this because it is open source and made in Node.js. I decided not to use any styling frameworks, so I could showcase my straight css skills.

### Notable Features

- Populated dynamically using Strapi as a CMS backend
- Amazon S3 integration for content images
- Straight CSS (SASS) without a styling engine
- Dynamic blog page system (not in current build)

### Possible Future Features

- Populate theme based on CMS
